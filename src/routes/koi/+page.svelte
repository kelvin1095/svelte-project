  <h1>Primary Concerns</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>pH: 7.0-8.5</li>
    <li>Ammonia: Near 0</li>
    <li>Nitrite: Near 0</li>
    <li>Nitrate: Below 40 ppm</li>
    <li>Chlorine: 0</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Primary Water Parameters: pH: Target Range: 7.0 to 8.5 pH measures the
    acidity or alkalinity of the water. Keep it within this range for the health
    of your Koi. Ammonia (NH3/NH4+): Target Range: Near Zero High ammonia levels
    can be toxic to Koi. Aim to keep ammonia as close to zero as possible.
    Nitrite (NO2-): Target Range: Near Zero Like ammonia, nitrite is toxic to
    Koi. Maintain nitrite levels as close to zero as possible. Nitrate (NO3-):
    Target Range: Below 40 ppm (parts per million) Nitrate is less toxic than
    ammonia and nitrite, but high levels can still harm Koi. Keep nitrate below
    40 ppm. Chlorine: Target Range: Zero Chlorine is harmful to fish. Ensure
    there is no detectable chlorine in your pond water. Use a dechlorinator if
    necessary when adding tap water. Secondary Water Parameters: Water
    Temperature: Target Range: 65째F to 75째F (18째C to 24째C) Maintain water
    temperature within this range to keep Koi healthy and comfortable. Dissolved
    Oxygen (DO): Target Range: Above 5 mg/L (milligrams per liter) Ensure there
    is enough dissolved oxygen in the water for Koi to breathe comfortably.
    Alkalinity (Carbonate Hardness - KH): Target Range: Varies Alkalinity
    stabilizes pH. The ideal KH level depends on your pond's specific needs.
    Consult local experts for recommendations. Hardness (General Hardness - GH):
    Target Range: Varies Hardness also affects water chemistry and can vary
    based on your pond setup. Consult experts for guidance. Phosphates (PO4):
    Target Range: Varies Keep phosphate levels as low as possible to minimize
    algae growth. Salinity (if used): Target Range: Varies Maintain salinity at
    the appropriate level if you use salt in your pond for treatment or other
    purposes. Turbidity (Water Clarity): Target Range: Clear Ensure water is
    clear and not excessively cloudy or murky. Water clarity affects aesthetics
    and water quality. Occasional or Specialized Tests: Copper (if used in
    treatments): If you use copper-based treatments, monitor copper levels to
    ensure they remain within safe limits. Metals and Contaminants
    (periodically): Periodically test for heavy metals and other contaminants in
    your pond water, especially if your water source is known to have potential
    pollutants. Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC): DOC levels can affect water
    quality and clarity, but specific target ranges may not be applicable.
    Organic Matter Decomposition (visual assessment): Regularly inspect your
    pond for the accumulation of organic matter and take action to remove it as
    needed.
